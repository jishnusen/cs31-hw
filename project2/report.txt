a) Some setbacks during the development process were as follows:
 * I had trouble with using `cin.ignore` and `getline` when taking in strings 
   from the user. 
 * I had some mathematical logic errors in getting the tariff rates to come out
   correctly. In this case I was applying the rates to the whole price, rather
   than after the base value of the tariff. ie. 2.9% on the whole price if above
   13000 rather than just (price - 13000).
