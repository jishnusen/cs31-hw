# Step 5 Tested Inputs

## Error Case 1
How many registered voters were surveyed? 10 
How many of them say they will vote for Joe? 5
How many of them say they will vote for Donald? 7

50.0% say they will vote for Joe.
70.0% say they will vote for Donald.
Donald is predicted to win the election.

A sum of Joe + Donald votes larger than the number of voters simply results in a total percentage > 100%, a nonsensical result.

## Error Case 2
How many registered voters were surveyed? -10
How many of them say they will vote for Joe? 5
How many of them say they will vote for Donald? 5

-50.0% say they will vote for Joe.
-50.0% say they will vote for Donald.
Donald is predicted to win the election.

Negative inputs result in negative percentages, which are nonsensical.

# Logic Errors Introduced
ln 20 and 21 have the percentage formula flipped. This causes both order of operations to resolve incorrectly by dividing by 100, and is also the incorrect formula for a percentage. 

ex)
How many registered voters were surveyed? 10
How many of them say they will vote for Joe? 5
How many of them say they will vote for Donald? 5

0.5% say they will vote for Joe.
0.5% say they will vote for Donald.
Donald is predicted to win the election.

As can be seen, the "0.5%" results from (5 / 100.0)

# Compile Errors Introduced
ln 13: semicolon missing at end of line
ln 23: no namespace provided for ios::fixed constant, so unresolved + function parameter type mismatch
